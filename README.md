# Milestone 1 - Data Science for Public Policy
Milestone 1.  （Until 2025/4/28）

We aim to select and clean data, generate descriptive statistics.

The data I used is from European Central Bank(ECB), one is the quarterly private consumption data from April, 1995 to December, 2024, of 20 EU zone countries. The other is quarterly housing wealth data from April, 2009 to October,2024. 
The ecbdata is a library built in PyPI, so I use pip install ecbdata. I modify our py file to include this line of code at the start, and I checked that it works on binder notebook, if I run pip install ecbdata first and restart the kernel.
